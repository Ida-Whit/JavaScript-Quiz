## Usage
Use this quiz to test your knowledge of JavaScript. Each time the user clicks on an option, the quiz advances to the next question. If the user answers a question wrong, 10 seconds get deducted from the timer. By the end of the quiz, the users score is determined by how much time is left on the timer. If the user clicks "View Previous Score" in the upper left corner of the page they can view the previous users initials and score. If the user finds themselves halfway through the quiz or on the score screen and would like to try the quiz again, they can click "Return to Start" in the upper left corner to stop the current timer and return to the start screen.
