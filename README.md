## Usage
Use this quiz to test your knowledge of JavaScript. Each time the user clicks on an option, the quiz advances to the next question. If the user answers a question wrong, 10 seconds get deducted from the timer. By the end of the quiz, the users score is determined by how much time is left on the timer. If the user clicks "View Previous Score" in the upper left corner of the page they can view a list of scores from previous users who have taken the quiz. If the user finds themselves halfway through the quiz or on the score screen and would like to try the quiz again, they can click "Return to Start" in the upper left corner to stop the current timer and return to the start screen. If the user would like to clear out the high scores list, they can click on "Clear Scores" to clear out local storage and clear the high scores page. If the user does not enter any initials in at the results screen they will be met with a message urging them to enter valid initials or the score will not be logged.
