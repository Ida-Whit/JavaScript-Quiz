## JavaScript-Quiz

## Description
This is a program that quizes users on basic JavaScript information learned so far in the coding bootcamp. Upon clicking the "Start" button, a timer begins counting down from 90 seconds and the first question displays. Each time the user clicks on an option, the quiz advances to the next question. If the user answers a question wrong, 10 seconds get deducted from the timer. By the end of the quiz, the users score is determined by how much time is left on the timer.
